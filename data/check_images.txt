4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: Since they provided same results and accuracy for the 4 uploaded photoes, I chose the running time as a factor to differentiate between them. What I noticed is that 
alexnet and resnet models are closley related to their running time with 58:59 and 58:58 respectively. On the other hand the vgg model has
different running time with 58:54 which persumably made me to pick it since its running time is faster than others
